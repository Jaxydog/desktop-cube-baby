## Installation

Desktop Cube Baby can be installed through one of the following methods:

### Download the latest release

Desktop Cube Baby's latest releases will be available through [this repository's 'releases' section][1].

### Compile from source

You may alternatively download Desktop Cube Baby's source code directly,
compile, and install it yourself.

Please note that the texture must be extracted manually,
however,
as it is not distributed with this repository.
The extracted file must be placed within `./src/cube_baby.png`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jaxydog/desktop-cube-baby.git
cd ./desktop-cube-baby
cargo build --release
cp ./target/release/desktop-cube-baby /path/to/destination
cargo clean
```

## Usage

To use Desktop Cube Baby,
just run the executable.

The application is set to be always-on-top,
so that the baby is always perfectly visible.

Please note that on some graphics devices,
the application will not have proper window transparency.
Unfortunately,
this is not something that I can resolve myself.
